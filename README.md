This repository contains R functions and examples developed for the project **"An Approach to Small Area Estimation of Child Chronic Malnutrition in Ecuador"**, authored by Diego Villacreses and Domingo Morales. The methodology implements **Nested Error Regression (NER)** models with **Empirical Best Prediction (EBP)** to estimate the prevalence of chronic malnutrition in children at the **canton level** using survey and census data.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Due to data privacy policies, this repository includes only code examples. No datasets are provided.

## üß† Core Methodology

We use Small Area Estimation (SAE) techniques via the **NER model**, with enhancements including:

- **Empirical Best Prediction (EBP)**
- **Bootstrap Mean Squared Error (MSE) estimation**
- **Conformity condition (benchmarking)**
- **Variable selection via Adaptive Elastic-Net**

## üì¶ Functions

The repository includes custom R functions to perform:

- `ner_ebp_n1()` / `ner_ebp_nG()` ‚Äì Estimate EBP for domains with/without survey data.
- `NER_boots()` ‚Äì Bootstrap MSE for EBPs.
- `ner_ebp_nG_CC()` ‚Äì Benchmarking EBPs using a conformity constraint.
- `NER_boots_CC()` ‚Äì Bootstrap MSE under conformity.
- `step_AIC_glmm.forw.dv()` ‚Äì Forward stepwise selection using AIC/BIC.
- `glmm_all_txs()` ‚Äì Evaluate GLMMs across covariate sets.
